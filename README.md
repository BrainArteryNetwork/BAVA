# Brain Artery Visualization & Analysis Tool (BAVA)

BAVA is a cutting-edge online platform designed for medical researchers focusing on neurology, particularly in the study of brain artery networks. It integrates powerful visualization tools with statistical analysis and machine learning capabilities to facilitate the exploration and prediction of vascular diseases.

## Features

- **3D Visualization**: Interactive 3D rendering of brain artery graphs with capabilities such as zoom, rotate, and pan to explore intricate vascular structures.
- **Data Filtering**: Advanced filtering options to refine datasets based on demographic, clinical, and morphological criteria.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Built-in tools for conducting basic statistical analysis, providing insights into the dataset through visual representations.
- **Digital Twin Simulation**: Creation of digital twins for simulated studies and analyses of brain artery networks.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Machine learning models to predict disease progression and outcomes based on historical and real-time data.

## Getting Started

To get started with BAVA, please follow the instructions below:

### Prerequisites
