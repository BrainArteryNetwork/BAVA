# Graphic Interface Specification

## Name:
- GUI for Brain Artery Visualization and Analysis (BAVA)

## Core Functionalities:

### Display Data:
- Real-time rendering of 3D brain artery graphs with zoom, rotate, and pan capabilities.
- Multi-dimensional scaling to view complex data in a simplified 2D form when necessary.
- Layered display options to show/hide different data sets or aspects of the data (e.g., demographic overlays, clinical information, etc.).

### Data Operation:
- Support for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the data.
- Ability to manipulate the visualization, such as adjusting the threshold for imaging or changing color maps for better distinction of features.

### Filter/Search:
- Advanced filtering options to view data by various parameters like age, gender, medical condition, etc.
- Search functionality to quickly locate specific data sets or patient records using keywords or phrases.

### Inputs:
- **Database:** Seamless integration with the backend database to fetch and update data.
- **User Input:** Interactive forms and controls for user input to customize data queries and visualization parameters.
- **Plot Interactions (2D + 3D):** Tools to interact with both 2D and 3D plots, including selection of regions of interest, annotations, and measurements within the 
graph.
- **Text Input:** Text fields for entering specific query parameters or notes.
- **Filter/Subset Input:** Dropdowns, sliders, and checkboxes for setting filters and creating data subsets.

### Outputs:
- **Plot:** Dynamic generation of plots that can be adjusted in real-time based on user interaction.
- **Stats Report:** Automated generation of statistical reports that summarize the demographic, clinical, and morphological data, with options to customize the report 
based on user-selected parameters.
- **Download:** Facility to download the processed medical data and visualizations in various formats (e.g., CSV, PDF, PNG, etc.).

### Integration with Other Components:
- **Retrieve Data from Database:** The GUI should have a robust backend connection to pull data from various tables and collections within the database.
- **Userâ€™s Computer Display:** The GUI should be responsive and adaptable to different screen sizes and resolutions, ensuring a consistent user experience across 
devices.

## Additional Features:

### User Management:
- Login/Logout functionality.
- Role-based access control to restrict certain operations or data based on user roles.

### Collaboration Tools:
- Annotation tools for collaborative review of visualizations.
- Sharing options to allow for easy distribution of reports and data visualizations among peers.

### Data Security:
- All data transmissions should be encrypted.
- Compliance with medical data protection standards (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR).

### Help and Documentation:
- Interactive tutorials for first-time users.
- Comprehensive documentation on how to use the GUI and interpret the data.
